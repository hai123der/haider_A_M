Hello all
I would like to present to you my work in embedded systems, especially in the PIC
I made an induction PIC16F877A circuit for  beginners, especially university students
Using AUTODESK  EAGLE  program  I did the electrical design of the circuit
where the design can be taken to PCB factories and printed it
Where it can be made a product as ARDUINO,RASPBERRY PI .....  
and marketed to the world with a memory card or flash or DVD containing a demo code
I made simulations on the PROTEUS program in order to test the experimental code
I hope you like it
